# RustGrad

RustGrad is a small deep learning framework developed in Rust. It currently features a slow, unoptimized implementation, focusing primarily on accurately delivering the intended functionality.

It is a toy project for understanding neural network, but the long-term goal is to develop it into a practical and useful framework.
